          Recent Flatiron School and UTSA college graduate. I have an innate
          desire to create and bring my ideas to life which which led me to
          pursue a music degree, but my skills in critical thinking, problem
          solving, and logic drew me to pursue a career in tech as well. I am
          ambitious and have a deep-rooted desire perform exceptionally in any
          job I am involved in. </p>

          After completing my BM with a concentration in
          classical guitar and a good deal of computer science classes under my
          belt I decided to enroll in the software engineering Flatiron
          bootcamp. After years of investing in my education I feel well
          equipped to begin my career in software engineering.

          I have been a private music instructor for seven years and I have experience with
          big classroom setting as well. Thanks to my success in music I have
          had the opportunity to travel a great deal. In the summer of 2012 I
          was apart of a troupe of guitarists that toured Germany. I toured Cuba
          in the Spring of 2017 with a quartet. In the spring of 2018 I studied
          a semester abroad in Italy where I lived for four months. While in
          Italy I was able to visit Spain, France, Germany (again), and Ireland!
          It was thanks to these experiences that I developed a love for
          traveling.
